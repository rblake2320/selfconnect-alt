# Runbook: Submit pending input in Claude Code TUI via WM_CHAR 0x0D

## What
Submit text sitting in a Claude Code input bar when SetForegroundWindow+SendInput fails

## Prerequisites
- `self_connect` available on sys.path

## Steps
1. Check if input is pending: get_text_uia(hwnd); look for '❯' cursor with text after it
2. Post WM_CHAR 0x000D to the parent WT window: user32.PostMessageW(hwnd, 0x0102, 0x000D, 0x001C0001)
3. Verify: text length increases and '❯ ' becomes empty — submission succeeded
4. Note: WM_KEYDOWN VK_RETURN and SendInput both fail for Claude Code TUI. Only WM_CHAR 0x0D works as PostMessage. This bypasses Windows Terminal's XAML input routing.
